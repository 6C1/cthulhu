C --> brainfsck (via http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/libbf )\r\n2. brainfsck --> unary (via custom compilation)\r\n3. unary --> hexadecimal string\r\n4. The final string is huffman encoded and stored in a binary file.\r\n\r\n#### Runtime interpretation\r\n\r\n1. Huffman decoding\r\n2. Compilation to brainfsck\r\n3. brainfsck interpreter\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\n### Unary and Brainfsck\r\n\r\nUnary is an ultra-minimalist [esoteric language](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language) \r\nconsisting of repetitions of a single character. This string represents a series of commands in \r\n[brainfsck](http://esolangs.org/w/index.php?title=Brainfsck), a tape-based esoteric language consisting \r\nof eight pointer commands invented by [Urban MÃ¼ller](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Urban_M%C3%BCller).\r\n\r\n### Huffman Encoding\r\n\r\n[Huffman encoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) is an entropy encoding algorithm based on a code table.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nCTHULHU will be implemented in ANSI C.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
